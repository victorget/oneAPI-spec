 oneAPI Specification Releases
===============================


This document lists releases of oneAPI specifications.

In addition to be published as part of the oneAPI spefication, some of
the components publish specifications independent from the oneAPI
specification. Typically, a oneAPI specification includes a snapshot
of the latest approved release of the component. This page lists
releases of the oneAPI specification and releases of component
specifications.  Releases of collections of oneAPI components
(e.g. Intel oneAPI Basekit) identify the version of the oneAPI
specification that it supports.


oneAPI Specification
====================

The latest approved specification is 1.0. The 1.1 specification is
under development and is labeled *provisional* until it is approved.
Releases are listed below. See GitHub_ for the latest build.

1.1 rev 1
~~~~~~~~~

Changes since 1.0

* Ray Tracing: Added

  * Ray tracing capabilities have been added to the oneAPI
    specification providing software developers across the industry
    the ability to “write once” for high-fidelity ray-traced
    computations across multiple vendors’ systems and
    accelerators. Standardizing these interfaces provides
    well-designed, tried and true APIs and options for a broad set of
    compute and rendering infrastructure development.

  * The ray tracing functionality is subdivided into several
    domains within the oneAPI Specification:

    * Geometric ray tracing computations
    * Volumetric computation and rendering
    * Image denoising
    * Scalable rendering and visualization infrastructure

  * The set of Ray Tracing APIs include the following, which
    are in active use via the Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit:

    * Embree
    * Open Volume Kernel Library
    * Open Image Denoise
    * OSPRay

* oneMKL:

  Introduces additional batched APIs for dense linear algebra. Sparse
  matrix-dense matrix product has been extended to support both row
  and column major layout for the dense matrix. The input USM pointers
  in the vector math APIs are now const qualified. To align with
  changes in SYCL 2020, all oneMKL USM APIs were updated to take an
  (optional) std::vector of input events instead of
  sycl::vector_class. Other changes include minor clarifications and
  bug fixes.

* DPC++

  The new extensions listed as part of oneAPI 1.1 include simplified
  device selection through text-based filtering, a default context for
  each platform to simplify common coding patterns, interoperability
  with devices that use Level Zero as a backend, an easier to use
  kernel-scope local memory allocation mechanism, GPU-specific
  information queries, FPGA-specific performance tuning controls, and
  a sub-group mask feature.

  DPC++ features that were incorporated into the SYCL 2020 spec were
  removed from this document.

* oneVPL

  New AV1 encode features. Enabled support for planar I422, I210, and
  BGR formats. Added surface pool interface for surface management.

* Level Zero

  Updates included significantly improved image processing
  functionality, better interoperability with other APIs and operating
  systems, new extensions for floating-point atomics and additional
  subgroup operations, and extensions to tune and optimize the way
  memory is allocated and kernels are scheduled on specific devices.
